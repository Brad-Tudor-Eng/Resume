# About Me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of writing this Iâ€™ve coded in 10 different languages, built an IOT greenhouse from scratch and written code for web, mobile, and digital accessories.  I have a high level knowledge of JavaScript, focused mainly around web development and the MERN Stack.  But, have also built a complete flight data logger and navigation aid with no prior knowledge of the language or device in under a month.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've served as the software architecht for most critical systems.  I've designed, and implemented a full featured recomendation system from scratch, database syncronization layer, content resource management and search functionality.   In previous roles, I served as a subject matter expert, and conducted live technical interviews in several different programming languages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before switching careers I was promoted to the Director of Engineering for Stewart Filmscreen.  I have 10 years of industry experience focusing on cradle grave new product development, continuous product improvement, process automation, manufacturing \ support and warranty analysis.  I am Experienced in new employee training and mentorship.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between my experience working as the primary engineer for a small but rapidly growing startup, and my successful career as a mechanical engineer I'm sure to make a valuable addition to any team.

Thank you,
