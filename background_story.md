<h2>A Quick Story</h2>
<p>
A lot of people have asked why, I’m switching from Mechanical Engineering to Software Development.  My hope in sharing this story is to answer that question.
</p>
<p>
When I was 7 I taught myself Visual Basic.  Enamored with the ability to create something, I started making little games.  Nothing to impressive, just little apps to entertain myself.  As time went on, I found that mechanical engineering jobs were more prevalent in home community.  So when college came around I started off on that career path.  
</p>
<p>
Since then I held several jobs and excelled in each one of those positions.  For one company I created their fastest selling product-line from scratch.  In another I designed and developed one of their top selling products. Even though there’s been a lot of change, one thing had always remained consistent, every time I ran into a challenge which required some kind of coding I’d become consumed.
</p>
<p>
	An example of this is when I developed the software for PAI to reverse engineer camshafts.  The company had bought a new machine and tasked me with setting up this process.  As I started in on the project it quickly became apparent that in its current state, the data the machine generated was not useable.  So pencil to paper, fingers to key board, I developed the code to take that data, filter out the noise, and translate it into a 2d sketch in Solidworks.  Several times throughout this project I forgot about lunch, I’d sit down to work and the next thing I knew it’d be time to go home.

	In my next job the cycle continued to repeat itself.  I’d find a problem that could easily be solved with a few lines of code, sit down to program a solution, and time would disappear.  Then one day it clicked.  This is what I should be doing with my life.
</p>  
<p>
	Ever since that moment in early 2017 I’ve spent every free moment of my time learning as much as possible about web development.  I started my studies out by focusing on Javascript, the MERN and other technologies such as GraphQL, and Docker.  Currently my focus is on mastering server-less architecture, earning my AWS Developer Certification and learning more about Java.
